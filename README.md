This is a random password generator.

This assignment required building a few functions that gather a user's password preferences through a series of prompts, and creating a string of randomly generated characters that meets their inputted criteria. I chose to create four different arrays of character types, and then create a function that would check which character types the user wanted, and grab a character from that array if it was true. However, I realized along the way that there are numerous different ways to achieve the same end result. I had the opportunity to do a lot of independent learning and problem solving with this assignment, which always feels like the best way to learn. I realized that what I perceive to be the most challenging aspect of an assignment is often not the most challenging aspect, and that psuedocoding before diving in can truly save you hours of work.
