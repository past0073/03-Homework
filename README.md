This is a random password generator.

This app required building a few functions that gather a user's password preferences through a series of prompts, and creating a string of randomly generated characters that meets their inputted criteria. I chose to create four different arrays of character types, and then create a function that would check which character types the user wanted, and grab a character from that array if it was true.

Technologies used:
### HTML
### CSS
### javaScript
